# Project Title: A food order application (MoreHungry)

## What will the application do?

*MoreHungry*  is an application that will:
- display food selections available for order
- display current order balance
- make recommendation or suggestions when needed


## Who will use it?
*MoreHungry* is intended for restaurants owners:
- who need simple graphical interfaces for 
customers to order food
- whose customers will be able to use it to order food and
know how much to pay, wait time, etc.

## Why is this project of interest to you?

Since restaurants are everywhere and is part of our
living. I would like to make an application that 
might have usage in our daily living. 


## *User Stories*
- I want to see what combo/individual selections
  are available to choose from and the price of
  each combo/items.
- I could add item and remove items as wishes.
- Know how much I have to pay at the moment.
- order number
- approximate wait time
